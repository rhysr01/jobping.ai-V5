## ⚠️ **PRODUCTION BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Launch)**

### **🚨 Critical Issues (Fix Required)**

#### **1. Email Authentication & Deliverability**
```bash
# Status: ❌ NOT READY
# Impact: HIGH - Users won't receive emails
```
**Issues**:
- DNS records not configured for `jobping.ai` domain
- SPF, DKIM, DMARC records missing
- Email deliverability not tested with major providers

**Fix Required**:
```bash
# Configure DNS records for jobping.ai
# Test email delivery to Gmail, Outlook, corporate inboxes
# Verify unsubscribe links work
```

#### **2. Legal & Privacy Compliance**
```bash
# Status: ❌ NOT READY  
# Impact: HIGH - Legal risk and GDPR compliance
```
**Missing**:
- Privacy Policy page
- Terms of Service page
- Data deletion endpoint
- GDPR compliance measures
- Cookie consent (if applicable)

**Fix Required**:
```html
<!-- Create legal pages -->
/privacy-policy
/terms-of-service
/api/user/delete-data
```

#### **3. Database Migration Status**
```bash
# Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY READY
# Impact: MEDIUM - Some features may not work
```
**Pending Migrations**:
- Enhanced feedback system tables
- Email tracking tables
- Some index optimizations

**Fix Required**:
```sql
-- Run pending migrations in Supabase dashboard
-- Verify all tables exist and have correct schemas
```

### **🔧 Minor Issues (Fix Recommended)**

#### **4. Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Status: ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION
# Impact: MEDIUM - System may not start properly
```
**Verify**:
- All required environment variables set
- Email service (Resend) active and tested
- OpenAI API access confirmed
- Redis connection stable

#### **5. Rate Limiting Tuning**
```bash
# Status: ⚠️ NEEDS PILOT TESTING
# Impact: MEDIUM - May be too restrictive or too permissive
```
**Current Limits**:
- Free: 10 requests per 15 minutes
- Premium: 50 requests per 15 minutes

**Verify**:
- Limits appropriate for pilot size
- Graceful degradation when limits hit
- Monitoring and alerting working
