- Check for different URL patterns (e.g., `company-name-2`, `companyname`)

#### **B. Use LinkedIn Job Search**
- Search for "Lever" in job descriptions
- Look for companies that mention Lever in their career pages
- Check for "Powered by Lever" badges

#### **C. Lever's Public Directory**
- Some companies may be listed in Lever's public directory
- Check Lever's partner showcase or customer list

### 3. **Manual Verification Process**

For any new company you want to add:

1. **Test the URL**: `https://jobs.lever.co/{company-slug}`
2. **Check for job postings**: Look for `.posting` elements
3. **Search for graduate keywords**: junior, associate, entry-level, graduate
