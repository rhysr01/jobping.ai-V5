Raw response: Given the user's profile and the job listings provided, here are the personalized job matches:

### 1. Associate Data Engineer at Sayari
- **Reasoning**: The user is a recent graduate, which aligns with the Associate Data Engineer position at Sayari that requires 0-2+ years of experience. This role is remote, fitting the user's preference, and does not require visa sponsorship, which is compatible with the user being an EU citizen.
- **Location**: Remote, compatible with the user's flexibility on location.
- **Experience Level**: Entry-level, suitable for a recent graduate.
- **Skills and Learning Opportunities**: Offers a chance to work with Python or JVM programming languages, SQL databases, and ETL pipelines in cloud environments, which could be beneficial for a graduate looking to start a career in data engineering.

### 2. Junior Network Engineer at Kyivstar
- **Reasoning**: This position is tailored for individuals at the beginning of their career path in network engineering, making it a good match for a recent graduate. The job is remote and seems to offer a supportive environment for learning and growth.
- **Location**: Remote, aligning with the user's location preference.
- **Experience Level**: Junior level, making it accessible for someone who is just starting out.
- **Skills and Learning Opportunities**: The role involves working with network protocols and concepts, and troubleshooting network devices, providing a solid foundation for a career in network engineering.

### Additional Considerations:
- The **Customer Support Engineer I Intern** at CloudWalk could offer a unique entry point into the tech industry, especially if the user is open to customer support roles. However, it requires fluency in Portuguese, which may or may not fit the user's language skills.
- The **Associate Director Clinical Monitoring** positions at WEP Clinical and WEP Clinical (possibly a duplicate listing with slight variations) demand significant experience in clinical research and leadership, which likely exceeds the user's current qualifications as a recent graduate.

### Recommendation:
The **Associate Data Engineer** position at Sayari and the **Junior Network Engineer** role at Kyivstar are the most suitable matches based on the user's profile. These positions offer the right level of challenge and learning opportunity for a recent graduate looking to enter the data engineering or network engineering fields, respectively. The user should consider applying to these positions first, while potentially exploring the Customer Support Engineer I Intern at CloudWalk if interested and linguistically qualified.
